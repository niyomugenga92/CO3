# My documentation

<!-- This is an example of participant's documentation for the Fabricademy program.

You can edit it on [Github](http://github.com/R-INYURU). The software used turns simple text files written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) format, into the site you are navigating.

Each time you change a page using the Gitlab interface, the site is rebuilt and all the changes published
in few minutes.

If this is your site, go on and edit this page clicking the Gitlab link on the upper right, changing the text below and deleting this.

No worries, you can't break anything, all the changes you make are saved under [Version Control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) using [GIT](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control). This means that you have all the different versions of your page saved and available all the time in the Gitlab interface.

This is an example of how you can structure your documentation, including ways of adding images, videos, tables e.t.c. Once you start editing make sure that you delete the examples and you make this page yours. -->



## About me

![](./images/grace.png){ width=200 align=right }
I am Niyomugenga Grace pursuing a Master of Science in IoT Embedded Computing Systems (ECS) at UR-ACEIoT, driven by a passion for digital fabrication, modeling, and the creative fusion of technology with problem-solving. This documentation site serves as a record of my learning journey in the Modeling & Fabrication course, where design and making converge to spark innovative solutions.

My work reflects my growth as an IoT engineer and embedded systems developer, with digital fabrication as a cornerstone for hardware prototyping and firmware integration. From PCB design to crafting physical enclosures, I am exploring how embedded systems evolve from abstract concepts into tangible products. Each step I document highlights the process of bridging software logic with hardware realities, shaping me into a firmware developer who thrives at the intersection of design, engineering, and fabrication.

## Course Overview: Modeling & Fabrication

### Digital Fabrication Revolution
Digital fabrication links digital design and physical production through computer-controlled tools such as CNC machines, laser cutters, and 3D printers. It evolved from manual craft and industrial manufacturing to enable rapid prototyping, precision, iteration, and hybrid workflows, transforming fabrication into an accessible process for innovation, education, and localized production.

### Course Structure
These 9-day intensive course covers the complete digital fabrication workflow, from foundational concepts to advanced multi-process integration:

1. **Foundations** - Modeling principles and fabrication ecosystems
2. **Digital Modeling** - CAD workflows and Design for Manufacturing (DFM)
3. **PCB Design** - Circuit design and milling techniques
4. **Materials** - Properties, selection, and fabrication methods
5. **Subtractive Methods** - CNC and laser cutting
6. **Additive Methods** - 3D printing technologies
7. **CNC Routing** - Advanced sheet fabrication
8. **Molding & Casting** - Replication processes
9. **Integration** - Final projects and documentation

## My Journey
Born and raised in Rwanda, I discovered an early fascination with electronics and communication technologies. I began cultivating hands-on expertise through professional training in fiber-optic installation and troubleshooting, which gave me a practical foundation in connectivity systems.

I went on to earn my Bachelor’s degree in Electronics and Telecommunication Engineering from the University of Rwanda, College of Science and Technology (School of Engineering). Building on this academic and technical base, I am now advancing my skills in embedded systems and IoT—focusing on the integration of electronics, communication, and smart connected devices. My journey is driven by a commitment to transforming theoretical knowledge into practical, real-world applications that improve everyday life and empower communities
