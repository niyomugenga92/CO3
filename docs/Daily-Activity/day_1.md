# 1. Activity of Day 1

# Foundations of Modeling & Fabrication

## Student Introduction
**This is Miss Niyomugenga Grace**, a Master of Science student in **IoT Embedded Computing Systems (ECS)** at University of Rwanda, ACEIoT. This portfolio documents my journey in Modeling & Fabrication.
## My Course Project: CO3 Nameplate
Throughout this course, I will design and fabricate a custom **CO3 nameplate** - an oval-shaped sign with carved lettering. This project will integrate multiple fabrication techniques learned across all 9 days, from initial concept to final finishing.
## Course Understanding
This documentation explores the core philosophy that **design and making are inseparable**.

In this module, we move beyond simple manufacturing to understand that design today is **computational, material-driven, and production-aware**.

### Project Brief: CO3 Nameplate
**Objective:** Design and fabricate a professional nameplate featuring "CO3" text
**Requirements:**
- Oval outer shape for aesthetic appeal
- Deeply carved/cut lettering for visual impact
- Smooth, professional finish suitable for display
- Demonstrate mastery of digital design and fabrication techniques

### Key Concepts
!!! quote "The Design-to-Fabrication Continuum"
    The process is not a straight line. It is an **iterative cycle**:
    
    1.  **Design:** Establishing intent.
    2.  **Model:** Representing form, logic, and behavior.
    3.  **Prototype:** Testing assumptions.
    4.  **Fabricate:** Transforming models into physical artifacts.
    5.  **Evaluate:** Using feedback to improve the design.

# Digital Modeling

## Initial Concept Sketching
Before jumping into CAD, I started with hand sketches to explore the design:

**Sketch 1: Layout Options**
- Explored different letter arrangements
- Tested oval vs. rectangular outer shapes
- Considered proportions and visual balance

**Sketch 2: Dimensional Planning**
- Overall dimensions: ~150mm x 90mm oval
- Letter height: ~40mm for "C", "O", "3"
- Depth of cut: 3-5mm for dramatic shadows
- Border thickness: 10-15mm around letters

**Design Decision:** Selected oval shape with vertically-stacked "CO3" for optimal visual impact and material efficiency.

## Modeling Workflow
Modeling is more than just creating a shape; it is the **representation of form, logic, and behavior**. My workflow incorporates two distinct approaches:

1.  **Geometric Modeling:** Defining static shapes and physical dimensions.
2.  **Parametric & Rule-Based Modeling:** Using parameters to enable variation without needing to redesign the entire object.

## Design Decisions
Every design choice was made with the understanding that **fabrication method is a design choice**.

### Parametric Thinking
By utilizing parametric thinking, I treat my models as **research tools**. This allows me to:
* Test assumptions about fit and function.
* Quickly adjust variables when physical constraints change.

# Fabrication Logic

## Fabrication Paradigms for the CO3 Nameplate
To transform my digital model into physical reality, I considered multiple fabrication approaches:

**Option 1: Laser Cutting (Subtractive)**
- Pros: Fast, precise, clean edges
- Cons: Limited to 2D cutting, no depth variation
- Best for: Flat nameplate with through-cuts

**Option 2: CNC Router Milling (Subtractive)**
- Pros: Can create depth, 2.5D carving, professional finish
- Cons: Longer fabrication time, requires tool changes
- Best for: Carved lettering with depth

**Option 3: 3D Printing (Additive)**
- Pros: Rapid prototyping, complex geometries
- Cons: Visible layer lines, requires extensive finishing
- Best for: Initial prototypes and design validation

**Decision:** I will use **CNC router milling** for the final piece due to its ability to create depth and professional surface finish. However, I'll start with a 3D printed prototype to validate the design.

## Material & Tolerance Considerations
Real-world fabrication introduces physical constraints that digital models often ignore.

!!! warning "Designing for Imperfection"
    As noted in our coursework, real-world fabrication inevitably introduces **error and deformation**. 
    
    * **Tolerance:** I designed my parts with specific **tolerance limits** to ensure proper fit despite machine inaccuracy.
    * **Material Behavior:** The choice of material actively influenced the design outcome, requiring adjustments for shrinkage and flexibility.

# Prototyping & Iteration

## Rapid Prototyping Strategy for CO3 Nameplate
Prototyping validates design decisions before committing to final fabrication.

### Phase 1: Paper Mockup (Day 1)
**Purpose:** Validate size and proportions
**Method:** Print 1:1 scale outline on paper
**Result:** Confirmed 150mm x 90mm oval feels appropriately sized

### Phase 2: 3D Printed Prototype (Day 6)
**Purpose:** Test letter depth, overall aesthetics, and design refinement
**Material:** PLA plastic
**Timeline:** 2-3 hours print time
**Validation:** Check letter legibility, depth effectiveness, overall visual balance

### Phase 3: Test Cut on Scrap Material (Day 7)
**Purpose:** Validate CNC toolpaths and cutting parameters
**Material:** Scrap plywood
**Result:** Refine feeds, speeds, and depth settings

### Phase 4: Final Fabrication (Day 7-8)
**Material:** Premium wood or aluminum
**Process:** CNC router milling with optimized parameters
**Finishing:** Sanding, staining/painting, protective coating

# Reflection – Lessons Learned & Critical Analysis

## Day 1 Achievements
Today marked the beginning of the CO3 nameplate project. I established:
- Clear project objectives and requirements
- Initial design concepts through sketching
- Fabrication strategy (CNC milling for final, 3D printing for prototype)
- Prototyping timeline across the course

## The Iterative Process
The most important lesson from this module is that the process is **iterative, not linear**. For the CO3 nameplate:
1. I started with rough sketches to explore layout options
2. Defined critical dimensions and proportions
3. Planned a multi-phase prototyping approach
4. Selected appropriate fabrication methods for each phase

### Design Thinking for the CO3 Project
**Question:** Why an oval shape?
**Answer:** The oval provides visual softness while maximizing usable surface area and creating an elegant frame for the letters.

**Question:** Why vertically stacked letters?
**Answer:** Vertical stacking creates a strong visual axis, ensures letter legibility, and works well within the oval proportions.

## Next Steps for Day 2
Tomorrow I will:
1. Create the precise CAD model in FreeCAD
2. Define exact dimensions and tolerances
3. Export files in multiple formats (STL for 3D printing, DXF for CNC)
4. Validate the digital model against design requirements

## Final Learning Outcomes
Through Day 1, I have learned to:
1.  **Start with clear project requirements** before designing
2.  **Sketch before modeling** to explore options quickly
3.  **Plan the entire fabrication workflow** from the beginning
4.  **Select appropriate processes** for prototyping vs. final production

    \"The best designs emerge when fabrication logic informs the design process from day one, not as an afterthought.\"
