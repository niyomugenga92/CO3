- Defined specifications: 150mm × 90mm × 10mm, 4mm letter depth
- Researched fabrication methods (3D printing vs. CNC vs. laser)
- Decided: 3D print prototype → CNC mill final walnut

**Key Output:** Hand-drawn concept sketches with dimensions

---

#### Day 2: CAD Modeling in FreeCAD
**Activity:** Parametric 3D modeling of CO3 nameplate

**What I Did:**

  - **C:** 40mm height, 8mm stroke width, 110° arc
  - **O:** 38mm diameter circle, 8mm stroke
  - **3:** 40mm height, two curves + horizontal bar
- Applied 2mm corner radii to all edges
- Created pockets (4mm depth) using Boolean subtraction
- Exported files: STEP (CNC), STL (3D printing), DXF (laser cutting)

**Key Output:** `CO3_Nameplate.step`, `CO3_Nameplate.stl`, `CO3_Nameplate.dxf`

**Validation:** All dimensions verified in FreeCAD measurements

---

## Reflection: Lessons Learned Across 9 Days

### Technical Skills Acquired

**CAD Mastery:**
- Parametric modeling (sketch → pad → pocket → boolean operations)
- File format management (STEP for CNC, STL for printing, DXF for laser)
- Dimensional control and tolerances

**CAM & CNC:**
- Toolpath strategy: roughing → finishing → profiling
- Feeds/speeds for different materials
- Tool selection (flat endmill vs. ball nose)
- G-code generation and machine operation

**Finishing Craftsmanship:**
- Progressive sanding theory (never skip grits!)
- Stain penetration timing and wiping
- Multi-coat polyurethane technique

### Design Thinking Evolution

**Iteration is Everything:**
```
Sketch → CAD → Cardboard → PLA → Walnut
```
Each step validated the design and reduced risk. By the time I reached Day 7, I was confident the CAD model was perfect.

**Test in Cheap Materials First:**
- Cardboard template: $0.50, 90 seconds (caught dimensional issues)
- PLA prototype: $2, 3 hours (validated letter depth)
- Walnut final: $20, 42 minutes (no surprises!)

**Precision vs. Perfection:**
- ±0.1mm tolerance is achievable with CNC
- Hand finishing adds the "soul" that machines can't create
- Walnut grain adds organic beauty to geometric precision

### Problem-Solving Skills

**Challenges Overcome:**
1. **CAD learning curve:** FreeCAD is powerful but complex (solved with tutorials)
2. **Letter geometry:** Creating 3D letters from 2D fonts (solved with manual sketching)
3. **Material choice:** Balancing cost vs. appearance (decision matrix helped)
4. **CNC toolpaths:** Understanding roughing vs. finishing (CAM simulation clarified)
5. **Finish quality:** Avoiding stain blotches (proper sanding and timing)

### What I'd Do Differently

**If I repeated this project:**
- Use Fusion 360 instead of FreeCAD (better CAM integration)
- Make walnut blank slightly larger (reduce waste cutting tabs)
- Test stain on scrap walnut first (ensure color before applying)
- Add mounting holes in design (for hanging on wall)

**Future Enhancements:**
- LED backlighting (from Day 3 concept)
- Laser-engraved signature on bottom
- Multiple nameplates as gifts (CNC is reproducible!)
