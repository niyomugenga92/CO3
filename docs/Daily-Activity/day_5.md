# Day 5 – Laser Cutting: CO3 Template Validation

## Course Overview
Today I use laser cutting to create a full-scale cardboard template of the CO3 nameplate. This validates dimensions and proportions before committing to expensive walnut CNC milling.

---

## CO3 Project: Laser-Cut Validation Template

### Objective
Create an accurate 1:1 scale template of the CO3 nameplate oval outline to:
- Verify overall dimensions (150mm x 90mm)
- Test visual proportions and aesthetics
- Validate letter spacing and sizing
- Ensure design looks correct at actual size
- Practice file preparation for laser cutting

### Why Create a Template First?

!!! info "Prototype Before Production"
    Cardboard laser cutting takes 2 minutes and costs $0.50. CNC milling walnut takes 45 minutes and uses $20 material. Testing first prevents expensive mistakes!

## Laser Cutting Principles Applied to CO3

### File Preparation: CO3 Oval Template

**Step 1: Export DXF from FreeCAD**
1. Opened CO3 nameplate CAD model
2. Created new sketch on XY plane
3. Projected outer oval outline only
4. File → Export → DXF format
5. Saved as: `CO3_Oval_Outline.dxf`

**Step 2: Import into Laser Software**
1. Imported DXF into Lightburn
2. Verified dimensions: 150mm x 90mm ✓
3. Set stroke color to RED (cut line)
4. Positioned in laser bed center

## Laser Cutting Parameters for CO3 Template

| Parameter | Setting | Reason |
|-----------|---------|--------|
| **Speed** | 25 mm/s | Optimal for clean cardboard cuts |
| **Power** | 60% | Sufficient for 3mm cardboard |
| **Passes** | 1 | Single pass cuts through easily |
| **Focus** | Set to material surface | Critical for clean edges |
| **Air Assist** | ON | Prevents charring/burning |

---

## Safety Precautions

✓ **Critical Safety for CO3 Template Cut:**

- Never leave laser cutter unattended during operation
- Ensured proper ventilation ON
- Identified emergency stop button location
- Kept fire extinguisher nearby
- Removed flammable materials from area
- Wore safety glasses as required
- Instructor supervision present

---

## Laser Cutting Process: CO3 Template

### Step-by-Step Execution

**1. Material Preparation**
- Placed 3mm cardboard flat on laser bed
- Ensured no warping or curling
- Checked material was secure

**2. Focus Adjustment**
- Set laser focal point to cardboard surface
- Used focus tool for proper distance
- Verified focus was sharp

**3. Test Cut**
- Cut small 10mm circle in corner first
- Verified power setting cut completely through
- Confirmed no burning or incomplete cuts

**4. Final CO3 Template Cut**
- Sent job to laser cutter
- Monitored entire 90-second cut
- Observed smooth oval cutting
- Removed template carefully from bed

**Result:** Perfect 150mm x 90mm oval template! ✓

## Template Validation Results

### Dimensional Verification

**Measurements with Digital Calipers:**
- Width: 149.8mm (target: 150mm) ✓
- Height: 89.9mm (target: 90mm) ✓
- Variance: Within 0.2mm tolerance
- Kerf effect: ~0.1mm per side (expected)

### Visual Assessment

**Proportion Testing:**
- Held template at viewing distance
- Oval shape perfectly smooth and balanced
- Width-to-height ratio looks correct
- Border width adequate for letters

**Letter Position Mockup:**
- Sketched C, O, 3 positions on cardboard with pencil
- 5mm spacing between letters confirmed visually
- All letters fit comfortably within oval
- No crowding at top or bottom
- Alignment looks centered

### Design Validation Checklist

- Overall dimensions correct (150mm x 90mm)
- Oval proportions visually pleasing
- Letter sizes appropriate for space
- Letter spacing (5mm) works well
- Border width (12mm minimum) adequate
- Ready to proceed with 3D prototype
- Confident for final walnut CNC milling

---

## Understanding Kerf

**Kerf** is the material width removed by the laser beam.

**For CO3 Template:**
- Kerf width: ~0.2mm for cardboard
- Effect on 150mm oval: negligible (-0.1mm per side)
- Template slightly smaller than drawn line (expected)

**Important for Future:**
- CNC milling: Must account for bit diameter in CAM
- 4mm end mill removes 4mm width
- Toolpath center vs. edge matters
- Will address in Day 7 CAM programming

---

## 2D Fabrication Strategy: Laser vs. CNC

### What Laser Cutting Provides

**Advantages for Templates:**
- Extremely fast (90 seconds vs. 45 minutes CNC)
- Very low cost for testing
- Perfectly smooth curves
- No tool wear
- Ideal for validation mockups

**Limitations:**
- Cannot create depth (2D only)
- No 3D features possible
- Limited to through-cuts
- Material restrictions

### Why CNC Still Needed for Final CO3

The CO3 nameplate requires:
- 4mm deep carved letters (laser can't do depth)
- Hardwood walnut material (better than cardboard laser can cut)
- Smooth carved walls (end mill finish)
- Professional three-dimensional appearance

**Conclusion:** Laser validated design quickly and cheaply. CNC will create the final professional piece.

## Key Lessons: Toolpath Strategies

### File Preparation Best Practices

**DXF Export Checklist:**
- ✓ All curves converted to vectors
- ✓ No duplicate lines
- ✓ Closed paths verified
- ✓ Correct units (millimeters)
- ✓ Layer organization (cut vs. engrave)

### Assembly Methods Explored

While CO3 is a single-piece nameplate, laser cutting taught me about:
- **Slot and Tab:** Interlocking assembly
- **Press-Fit:** Friction-based joints
- **Finger Joints:** Strong box construction
- **Fasteners:** Through-holes for screws

*These techniques will be valuable for future projects requiring assembly.*

## Reflection: Day 5 Achievements

### What I Accomplished

Today I successfully:
- Prepared accurate DXF file from CAD model
- Set up and operated CO₂ laser cutter safely
- Cut precise cardboard template in under 2 minutes
- Validated CO3 dimensions at full scale
- Confirmed design proportions and aesthetics
- Built confidence for final fabrication

### The Value of Rapid Prototyping

!!! success "Prototyping Prevents Costly Mistakes"
    **Cost comparison:**
    - Cardboard template: $0.50 + 2 minutes
    - Walnut CNC mistake: $20 + 45 minutes + frustration
    
    **Testing first saved both money and material!**

### Laser Cutting vs. CNC Milling

| Aspect | Laser Cutting | CNC Milling (Day 7) |
|--------|---------------|---------------------|
| **Speed** | Very fast (seconds) | Slower (minutes-hours) |
| **Depth** | 2D through-cut only | Variable depth control ✓ |
| **Materials** | Cardboard, thin wood, acrylic | Hardwood, metal, thick materials ✓ |
| **Finish** | Burned edges | Smooth milled surface ✓ |
| **Cost/Speed** | Excellent for templates | Better for final pieces |
| **Best For** | Validation, 2D profiles | Final production, 3D features ✓ |

### Critical Insights

1. **Physical validation beats digital** - Seeing actual size revealed proportions CAD doesn't convey
2. **Cheap tests prevent expensive failures** - $0.50 cardboard vs. $20 walnut
3. **Kerf matters in precision work** - Must account for material removal
4. **Right tool for the job** - Each method has optimal applications
5. **Safety is non-negotiable** - Laser requires constant supervision

### Next Steps for Day 6

Tomorrow I will:
- 3D print complete CO3 nameplate prototype in PLA
- Test 4mm letter carving depth effectiveness
- Evaluate 3D visual impact of carved letters
- Identify any final design refinements needed
- Practice 3D printing workflow (CAD → Slicer → Print)
- Prepare mentally for final walnut CNC on Day 7

**Status:** CO3 project is on track! Design validated. Ready for prototype.

### Step 3 – Prepare the Laser File

Students must:

- Check scale and dimensions
- Remove duplicate lines
- Place objects efficiently to reduce material waste
- Export as:
  - `.SVG`
  - `.DXF`
  - `.PDF`

---

### Step 4 – Machine Setup

Students must:

- Turn ON:
  - Laser cutter
  - Air assist
  - Ventilation system
- Place material flat on the bed
- Focus the laser head correctly
- Set the **origin** (home position)

---

### Step 5 – Laser Cutting Parameters (Example)

| Material | Power (%) | Speed (mm/s) | Passes |
|--------|----------|--------------|--------|
| 3 mm plywood | 70–80 | 10–15 | 1 |
| 3 mm acrylic | 60–70 | 8–12 | 1 |
| Cardboard | 30–40 | 20–25 | 1 |

 Parameters may vary depending on the machine.

---

### Step 6 – Cutting Process

- Run a **frame test**
- Start the cutting job
- Monitor the process continuously
- Pause or stop if issues occur

---

### Step 7 – Post-Processing

Students must:

- Remove the cut pieces carefully
- Clean burnt edges if necessary
- Test fit components
- Record any design or cutting issues

---

## Example Laser-Cut Project

**Press-Fit Box / Key Holder / Phone Stand**

Design considerations:
- Material thickness tolerance
- Kerf compensation
- Tab and slot fit
